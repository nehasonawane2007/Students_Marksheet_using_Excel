ðŸ“Š Student Marksheet Data Analysis

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project demonstrates data cleaning and analysis in Excel using a student marks dataset. The goal was to clean raw data, apply formulas, create reports, and visualize insights for practice in data analysis.

ðŸ—‚ Dataset

Raw Dataset: Student_Data_Uncleaned.csv

Cleaned Dataset: Student_Data_Cleaned.csv

Steps Performed
1. Data Cleaning

Removed duplicates

Standardized columns

Added new calculated columns:

Total Marks â†’ =SUM(Subject1, Subject2, Subject3, ...)

Percentage â†’ (Total Marks / Maximum Marks) * 100

2. Excel Workbook Creation (Student_Marksheet.xlsx)

Converted dataset into a Table for structured formatting.

Used Slicer for easy filtering.

Applied VLOOKUP to quickly find Total Marks and Percentage for any student.

3. Data Analysis

Built a Pivot Table to analyze:

Class-wise minimum and maximum marks

Class-wise minimum and maximum percentage

4. Visualization

Created a Graph (chart) to show:

Maximum and Minimum Percentage by Class

ðŸ“ˆ Key Learnings

Data cleaning and preparation in Excel

Formula application for derived metrics

Lookup functions for quick search

Pivot tables for aggregated analysis

Charts for better visualization

ðŸ“‚ Files in Repository

Student_Data_Uncleaned.csv â†’ Original raw data

Student_Data_Cleaned.csv â†’ Cleaned dataset with calculated fields

Student_Marksheet.xlsx â†’ Final Excel workbook with analysis, pivot tables, and charts

ðŸš€ How to Use
